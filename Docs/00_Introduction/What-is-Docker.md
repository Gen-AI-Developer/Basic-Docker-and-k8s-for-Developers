# What is Docker?

According to the official Docker website:

> **Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.**  
> It allows you to separate your applications from the physical hardware (infrastructure), so you can deliver software faster. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure the same way you manage your applications. By using Docker’s methods for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can reduce the time it takes to go from writing code to running it in production.

Let’s break this down into simple terms:

1. **Open-source platform**: Docker is free to use and anyone can contribute to improve it.
2. **Developing**: You can create applications with Docker.
3. **Shipping**: Docker makes it easy to package and send applications to others.
4. **Running Applications**: It ensures that your applications work the same way on any machine.
5. **Separate from your infrastructure**: Your application is independent of the physical hardware it runs on.
6. **Same as your infrastructure**: Docker creates an environment that matches your system or your client’s system.
7. **Same management**: You manage your infrastructure (like servers) just like you manage your applications in docker, simplifying everything.

Docker makes the entire process of creating, sharing, and running applications faster and more efficient.
