# Abstract

Back in 2016, when I was an Android Developer at Coding Worms Software Solutions in the KP Government IT Park, Peshawar, we developed Android applications using Java. To compile our code for Android devices, we relied on tools like Gradle and Maven.

At that time, sharing our code was a real challenge. We often had to send files in ZIP or APK formats, but the client’s system would frequently encounter errors when trying to compile/run the same code.

To solve this problem, developers created a tool called **Docker**. Before we dive into what Docker is, imagine this:

How convenient would it be to develop an application in an environment identical to your client’s system? This is exactly what Docker enables. With Docker, you can create an environment, called a **Container**, that mirrors the client’s system. You develop the application inside this container, and the client can run it seamlessly in the same environment. The blueprint for creating a container is called an **Image**.

# Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that helps developers build, test, and deploy applications quickly and efficiently.

## **What are Containers?**

Containers are lightweight, isolated units that package everything an application needs to run, including code, libraries, and dependencies. They can run on any system without compatibility issues.

## **How is Docker Different from Virtual Machines (VMs)?**

- VMs have both a host operating system and a guest operating system for each virtual machine.
- Docker containers, however, share the host system’s operating system, making them much more efficient and resource-friendly.

# **Benefits of Docker**

Docker makes development faster and smoother by allowing developers to:

1. Work on application code without worrying about system compatibility.
2. Separate applications from the underlying infrastructure.
3. Deliver software more quickly.
4. Reduce the time between writing code and running it in production.

# **How Docker Works**

1. **Install Docker** on the server.
2. Use simple commands to build, start, or stop containers.
3. Run Docker as a client-server application with:
   - A **server** to manage containers.
   - **APIs** for communication.
   - A **command-line interface (CLI)** for easy interaction.

Docker is a game-changer for developers, making it simple to build and share applications in consistent environments. With Docker, coding and deployment become faster, easier, and more reliable.
