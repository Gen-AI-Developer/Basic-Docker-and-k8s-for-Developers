## 1. Application Design and Build (20%)

### 1.1 Define, Build, and Modify Container Images
Container images are the foundation of Kubernetes applications, encapsulating code and dependencies.

- **Specifying Images**:
  - Format: `[registry]/[namespace]/[image]:[tag]` or `@[digest]` (e.g., `docker.io/library/nginx:latest`, `registry.k8s.io/pause@sha256:1ff6c18fbef2045af6b9c16bf034cc421a29027b800e4f9b68ae9b1cb3e9ae07`).
  - Default registry: Docker Hub ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)).
  - Tags: Alphanumeric, up to 128 characters; default is `latest` if unspecified.
  - Digests: Use for immutability (e.g., `sha256:1ff6c18fbef2045af6b9c16bf034cc421a29027b800e4f9b68ae9b1cb3e9ae07`).

- **Image Pull Policies**:
  - `IfNotPresent`: Pull only if not present locally (default unless tag is `latest`).
  - `Always`: Pull every time, resolves to digest.
  - `Never`: Use local image, fails if not present.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: nginx:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    ```

- **Private Registries**:
  - Use `imagePullSecrets` for authentication.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: registry-secret
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: private.registry.com/myapp:1.0
    ```

- **Multi-Architecture Images**:
  - Kubernetes supports images for different architectures using image indices.
  - Names may include `-$(ARCH)` suffix for compatibility.

- **ImagePullBackOff**:
  - Occurs when image pull fails (e.g., invalid name, missing `imagePullSecrets`).
  - Kubernetes retries with delays up to 5 minutes.

- **Exam Tip**:
  - Focus on specifying images in pod/deployment YAMLs and configuring pull policies.
  - Use commands like `kubectl run test --image=busybox` or `kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml`.

### 1.2 Choose and Use Workload Resources
Kubernetes offers various workload resources for different application needs.

- **Deployment**:
  - Manages stateless applications with replicas and rolling updates.
  - Key fields: `replicas`, `selector`, `template`, `strategy`.
  - Rolling update settings: `maxSurge` (extra pods), `maxUnavailable` (unavailable pods).
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
      strategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxSurge: 1
          maxUnavailable: 0
    ```

- **StatefulSet**:
  - For stateful applications requiring stable identities and persistent storage.
  - Ordered deployment/scaling, uses headless services.
  - Example: Databases like MySQL.

- **DaemonSet**:
  - Runs a pod on each node (or selected nodes) for tasks like logging (e.g., Fluentd) or monitoring.
  - Automatically adds tolerations for node issues.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: DaemonSet
    metadata:
      name: fluentd
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: fluentd
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: fluentd
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: fluentd
            image: fluentd:v1.14
    ```

- **Job**:
  - Runs tasks to completion, supports parallelism.
  - Key fields: `completions`, `parallelism`, `backoffLimit`.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: pi
    spec:
      completions: 1
      parallelism: 1
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pi
            image: perl
            command: ["perl", "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
          restartPolicy: Never
    ```

- **CronJob**:
  - Schedules jobs using cron syntax.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: hello
    spec:
      schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
      jobTemplate:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: hello
                image: busybox
                command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "date; echo Hello"]
              restartPolicy: OnFailure
    ```

### 1.3 Multi-Container Pod Design Patterns
Multi-container pods enhance application functionality.

- **Sidecar**:
  - Helper container for logging, monitoring, or proxying.
  - Example: Nginx with a logging sidecar.

- **Init Containers**:
  - Run to completion before main containers, used for setup.
  - Example: Wait for a database service.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: init-myservice
        image: busybox:1.28
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting; sleep 2; done;']
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:1.0
    ```

- **Adapter**:
  - Transforms main container output (e.g., reformatting logs).

- **Ambassador**:
  - Proxies external communication for the main container.

- **Shared Volumes**:
  - Containers in a pod can share volumes (e.g., `emptyDir`) for data exchange.

### 1.4 Persistent and Ephemeral Volumes
Volumes provide storage for pods.

- **Ephemeral Volumes**:
  - Tied to pod lifecycle, deleted when pod terminates.
  - Types:
    - `emptyDir`: Temporary storage.
    - `configMap`, `secret`: Mount configuration data.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: mypod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: nginx
       		volumeMounts:
        - name: cache
          emptyDir: {}
    ```

- **Persistent Volumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)**:
  - PVs exist independently of pods, claimed via PVCs.
  - StorageClasses enable dynamic provisioning.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: mypvc
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      storageClassName: standard
    ```

## 2. Application Deployment (20%)

### 2.1 Deployment Strategies
- **Blue/Green**:
  - Run two environments (blue: current, green: new), switch traffic when ready.
  - Implementation: Use two deployments, update service selector.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: myapp
    spec:
      selector:
        app: myapp-green
      ports:
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
    ```

- **Canary**:
  - Gradually shift traffic to the new version.
  - Implementation: Adjust replicas in multiple deployments or use service mesh (e.g., Istio).

### 2.2 Deployments and Rolling Updates
- **Rolling Updates**:
  - Replace pods incrementally to minimize downtime.
  - Configure `maxSurge` (extra pods) and `maxUnavailable` (unavailable pods).
  - Commands:
    - Update: `kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:2.0`
    - Status: `kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp`
    - Rollback: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp`

### 2.3 Helm
- **Overview**:
  - Package manager for Kubernetes, using charts to define applications.
- **Key Commands**:
  - Install: `helm install my-release stable/nginx`
  - Upgrade: `helm upgrade my-release stable/nginx`
  - List: `helm list`
  - Repository: `helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable`
- **Exam Tip**:
  - Practice deploying charts from public repositories.

### 2.4 Kustomize
- **Overview**:
  - Customizes Kubernetes configurations using overlays and patches.
- **Key Commands**:
  - Apply: `kubectl apply -k ./kustomization.yaml`
  - Example `kustomization.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    resources:
    - deployment.yaml
    patches:
    - patch: |-
        - op: replace
          path: /spec/replicas
          value: 5
      target:
        kind: Deployment
        name: myapp
    ```

## 3. Application Observability and Maintenance (15%)

### 3.1 API Deprecations
- Use current API versions (e.g., `apps/v1` for deployments, not `extensions/v1beta1`).
- Check Kubernetes release notes for deprecated APIs ([Kubernetes Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)).

### 3.2 Probes and Health Checks
- **Liveness Probe**:
  - Restarts container if it fails.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 3
      periodSeconds: 3
    ```

- **Readiness Probe**:
  - Removes pod from service endpoints if it fails.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    readinessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
    ```

- **Startup Probe**:
  - Delays liveness checks for slow-starting containers.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /startup
        port: 8080
      failureThreshold: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
    ```

### 3.3 Monitoring Tools
- **Key Commands**:
  - Resource usage: `kubectl top pod`
  - Events: `kubectl get events`
  - Details: `kubectl describe pod mypod`
- **Exam Tip**:
  - Practice filtering events and interpreting output.

### 3.4 Container Logs
- View logs: `kubectl logs mypod -c mycontainer`
- Tail logs: `kubectl logs -f mypod`
- Exam Tip: Use logs for debugging application issues.

### 3.5 Debugging
- **Common Issues**:
  - CrashLoopBackOff: Check logs, resource limits.
  - ImagePullBackOff: Verify image name, registry access.
  - Pod not ready: Check probes, network policies.
- **Tools**:
  - `kubectl exec`: Access pod shell (`kubectl exec -it mypod -- /bin/sh`).
  - `kubectl describe`: View events and status.
  - `kubectl get`: Check resource states.

## 4. Application Environment, Configuration and Security (25%)

### 4.1 Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators
- **CRDs**:
  - Extend Kubernetes with custom resources.
  - Example: Deploy a CRD-based application.
- **Operators**:
  - Manage CRDs, automating complex tasks.
  - Exam Tip: Understand how to apply CRs, not create CRDs.

### 4.2 Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control
- **Authentication**:
  - Uses certificates, tokens, or other methods for user/service identity.
- **Authorization**:
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) defines permissions.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: pod-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["get", "list"]
    ```
- **Admission Control**:
  - Plugins like `AlwaysPullImages` modify/reject requests.
  - Exam Tip: Configure ServiceAccounts with appropriate roles.

### 4.3 Requests, Limits, and Quotas
- **Requests and Limits**:
  - Requests: Guaranteed resources.
  - Limits: Maximum resources.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "200Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "500Mi"
    ```
- **Resource Quotas**:
  - Limit namespace resource usage.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ResourceQuota
    metadata:
      name: compute-resources
    spec:
      hard:
        requests.cpu: "1"
        requests.memory: 1Gi
        limits.cpu: "2"
        limits.memory: 2Gi
    ```

### 4.4 ConfigMaps
- Store non-sensitive configuration data.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: my-config
  data:
    key1: value1
  ```
- Usage: Mount as volume or set as environment variables.
  ```yaml
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: myapp
      env:
      - name: KEY1
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: my-config
            key: key1
    ```

### 4.5 Secrets
- Store sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: my-secret
  type: Opaque
  data:
    password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # base64 encoded
  ```
- Usage: Similar to ConfigMaps, mount or use as environment variables.

### 4.6 ServiceAccounts
- Provide identities for pods to interact with the Kubernetes API.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: my-sa
  ```
- Assign to pod:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    serviceAccountName: my-sa
  ```

### 4.7 Application Security
- **Security Contexts**:
  - Control pod/container security settings.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 3000
        fsGroup: 2000
    ```
- **Capabilities**:
  - Add/drop Linux capabilities.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
            drop: ["SYS_TIME"]
    ```

## 5. Services and Networking (20%)

### 5.1 NetworkPolicies
- Control pod-to-pod traffic based on labels and ports.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-app
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: myapp
    ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: frontend
      ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 8080
  ```

### 5.2 Services
- Expose applications within or outside the cluster.
- Types:
  - `ClusterIP`: Internal access (default).
  - `NodePort`: Expose on node ports.
  - `LoadBalancer`: External load balancer.
  - `ExternalName`: Map to external DNS.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  spec:
    selector:
      app: myapp
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
    type: ClusterIP
  ```
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Verify selector matches pod labels.
  - Check port mappings.
  - Use `kubectl describe service` for events.

### 5.3 Ingress
- Expose HTTP/HTTPS routes to services.
- Requires an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx).
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: my-ingress
  spec:
    rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
          backend:
            service:
              name: my-service
              port:
                number: 80
  ```
- **Exam Tip**:
  - Practice defining Ingress rules and troubleshooting connectivity.
